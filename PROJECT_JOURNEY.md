Project Journey

This document is a small history of this project and the motivation behind it.

When I started this project, I didn’t really have much in mind. I wanted to create something from start to finish—not something complicated, but complete.

In the beginning, it was easy. Setting up a REST API was something I had done many times. But as the project grew, it started to get more complicated. Soon, I began thinking about what a production-ready app really needs.

Security and authorization were things I had never done before. In Spring, they are not exactly intuitive. I thought I could just add basic authentication and brush it aside, but as I tried to implement more features, I realized how ingrained security is throughout the entire application.

DevOps was also something I had never been too excited about. I had never written or touched shell scripts before, but I found it much harder to work without them. It’s just so much better to run a script that handles all the repetitive tasks in a single click.

Nginx and Docker were things I had some ideas about, but I had never gone in-depth. Reverse proxies? Containerization? At first, it seemed like overkill for this small project. But as I learned more, I realized how convenient it is to have Nginx manage connections and other web complexities, and to allow users to run the app without installing a bunch of dependencies manually.

Not everything was intuitive or easy to understand. There are many rules that aren’t explicit or obvious. But after getting everything done, it feels incredibly satisfying.

Documentation is another thing I avoided like the plague—much like any programmer. But without it, I don’t think I would have been able to stay on track.

Overall, this project has been more fun than I thought and more necessary than I expected. It has challenged me, taught me new skills, and given me a better understanding of what it takes to create a production-ready application.
